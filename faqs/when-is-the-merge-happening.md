**Short Answer:**<br>
The best current (non-official) estimate is sometime in Q3 2022.

**Long Answer:**<br>
At the time of writing there is no definitive date for "The Merge".

The Ethereum community is pushing for all effort to be focused on the switch to proof-of-stake (PoS).

The Ethereum PoS chain is currently running and underwent its first hard fork (Codenamed Altair) in October 2021.
